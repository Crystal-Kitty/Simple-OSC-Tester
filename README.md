problems im too lazy to fix:
sender is locked to sending to self so no cross device data this is just for testing
reciever is locked to 9001 so anything running on that will block it from launching (vrchat, usually vrchat addons like OSCLeash, VRCOSC, TTSChatbox, if it connects to vrchat i likely recieves on 9001 unless customised)
